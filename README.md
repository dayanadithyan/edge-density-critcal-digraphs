## Edge density for critical digraphs without the use of probabilistic methods

Analysis of edge density for directed graphs, focusing on k-critical graphs, particularly the number of edges ||G|| as a function of the number of vertices |G|. Both sparse and dense k-critical digraphs are checked their edge densities and checked against the probabilistic approach. [WIP]

 $$ y^*(k) = \frac{k^2}{2} - O(k) $$

is assumed to be the proof for this conjecture (Hoshino et al, 2011)

Multiple constructions and comparisons against  Bokal et al's method to determine if any similarity for edge density.

Expect this to be a 3-4 week long analysis. Currently WIP.
